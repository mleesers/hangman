# hangman
This is a simple hangman game with 3 choices of subject. There are ten random choices per subject. You have a certain amount of letter guesses before you lose, or one chance to guess the word.
I made this project because i wanted to test my skills with python programming and test my progress as this was something as I was unable to complete when i first started programming
